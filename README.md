## N8N-Agentic-Ai

**The pronunciation of "n8n" is "n-eight-n.."**

### Q1. What does **N8N** stand for?
**A1.** Node for Node (N8N).

### Q2. What is a Node?
**A2.** A **Node** is a basic building block in n8n that performs a specific function or task. Everything shown on the workflow canvasâ€”like triggers, actions, or servicesâ€”is represented as a node.

### Q3. Why do we say N8N? There's no "8" in "Node", so why?
**A3.** We say N8N because the word **Node** has 4 letters, and "N" + "8" (for the 4 letters) + "N" gives us N8N.

### Q4. What is the technical term for an AI Agent Node?
**A4.** An AI Agent node is often part of a **clustered node setup** when multiple nodes work together, but in technical terms, it's just an **AI Agent Node** unless part of a specific configuration.

### Q5. Why is it called a Clustered Node?
**A5.** It is called a Clustered Node because it combines multiple smaller components or nodes to work together as a group, often to improve performance or scalability.

### Q6. What is an Arrow in n8n?
**A6.** An Arrow in n8n shows the direction of the workflow and also represents the flow of data from one node to another.
